			<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>We're not just a software company. We started as journalists, writers, editors, designers, coders, and of course, fervent readers. We had ideas about what we wanted to create, but we weren't going to wait for the publishing world to catch up to us. We built Creatavist to publish our own labor of love: <a href="https://atavist.com/" target="_blank">The Atavist</a>, a digital magazine featuring award-winning original pieces of longform, nonfiction journalism. But Creatavist is not a tool just for us. We built it so that any individual or group could craft and publish amazing stories. The Creatavist community includes renowned writers like Karen Russell and Joshuah Bearman, established publishers like <em>The Paris Review,</em> TED, the Weather Channel, student magazines, artists, photographers, and more. We think you should be a part of it.</p>
