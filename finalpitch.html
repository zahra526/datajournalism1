<p><h2>Final Pitch: Executive Orders</h2></p>
<p>There's been a lot of recent discussion about President Obama using the power of executive order to deal with the issue of immigration. While opponents to Obama taking executive action have previously charged that this is behavior similar to a <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/01/obama-executive-orders-guns.html">king or a monarch</a>, many fail to realize that the president has actually used executive orders <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/orders.php">significantly less</a>than other presidents.</p>

<p>I'd like to create a timeline of presidents who have used executive orders to push their political agendas. The timeline would first be organized chronologically, highlighting each president's significant executive order, e.g. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, FDR's New Deal) along the timeline and then, with a click of a button, allow viewers the option to view a presidents list in either ascending or descending order according to the amount of executive orders used.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of presenting the data similar to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/09/06/voting-blocs/">example</a> I showed for my critique in class. I like how the navigation is easy for the viewer with arrows taking you from one voting bloc to the next. In my project, I'd like to do the same but with presidents who have used executive action in chronological order. I'd like to have a row of each president's picture at the bottom (like the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/09/06/voting-blocs/">skyline</a> in the example) and then set other presidents on either side of the one that is currently clicked to a lighter opacity. In other words, a president's picture and his information would only be clear if that's the one you have clicked on. (I'm not sure if I explained that clearly, but I can explain it in class.)</p>

<p>For the ascending/descending list, I don't know if it would be a good idea to rearrange the chronological timeline, or take the viewers to an entirely different list/graph-kind of thing by clicking some button or link that would take them there. I think that kind of information would be easier to digest if it looked like <a href="http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2013/01/15/15-presidential-orders.w529.h746.png">this</a> graph.</p>

<p>I understand that this idea isn't completely original because there have been graphs showing the amount of executive orders from each president, but I want to show more information with my data project and I think it's important to understand what kind of significant events have taken place throughout history because of executive action. For those reasons, I think my project would be different than all the other data that has come out about this.</p>

<p>Data/Information I would need for this project:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/orders.php">Number of executive orders from each president</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/executive_orders.php?year=2014&Submit=DISPLAY">Descriptions of certain executive orders</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/20519/executive-orders-famous-infamous-ridiculous">Significant executive orders (I'm sure there are more and I plan to find that as I work on each president.)</a></li>
</ul>
