  <h1>I'VE GOT THE (EXECUTIVE) POWER!</h1>
  
  <p id>When President Barack Obama used his legal executive authority to announce his new immigration plan on November 20, many opponents in Congress charged that this move was similar to a king or a monarch.</p>

  <p>But for over half a century, American presidents have used their executive powers to relieve deportation fears for immigrant individuals and families. In fact, every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has taken executive action on immigration.</p>

  <p>Below is a breakdown of those numbers according to the <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/docs/executive_grants_of_temporary_immigration_relief_1956-present_final_4.pdf">American Immigration Council.</a></p>

  <!-- INSERT BAR CHART -->

  <p>As the numbers show, Obama has provided 1.8 million childhood arrivals with deportation relief in 2012 under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA – accounting for a third of total immigration relief since 1956.

  <p>In total, Obama’s new plan will provide deportation relief for 5.67 million immigrant, including 4 million immigrant parents who will be protected from deportation if they have been in the U.S. for at least five years and have kids who are citizens or legal residents by green card.

 <!-- INSERT POP-OUT TEXT. In addition, the White House estimates that under Obama’s new immigration plan, 1.2 million people are now eligible for DACA, 270,000 unauthorized immigrants over age 30 are eligible under an expansion of DACA and 200,000 more immigrants under smaller reforms. -->

  <p>That number is strikingly higher than any other amount of immigrants who received relief under other previous Democratic or Republican presidents’ executive actions on immigration. 

  <p>But surprisingly, Republican president George H.W. Bush (a.k.a. Bush Sr.) has provided the second-most relief for immigrants at more than 1.6 million – and that’s not even including his deferred deportation plan for 190,000 El Salvadorans that President Bill Clinton continued in 1992.

  <p>But Bush Sr. did this with the help of a bipartisan-acting Congress that agreed that the immigration laws back then needed a massive overhaul. He wasn’t trying to work with today’s polarized Congress, where many of Obama’s plans lead to gridlock, ultimately leading to a government shutdown.
