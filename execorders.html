  <h1>I'VE GOT THE (EXECUTIVE) POWER!</h1>
  
  <h4>BY ZAHRA AHMED, Dec. 11, 2014a</h4>

  <p>When President Barack Obama used his legal executive authority to announce his new immigration plan on Nov. 20, 2014, many opponents in Congress charged that this move was similar to a king or a monarch abusing their power.</p>

  <p>But for over half a century, American presidents have used their executive powers to relieve immigrant individuals and families of deportation. In fact, every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has taken executive action on immigration.</p>

  <p>Democratic and Republican presidents alike have passed executive actions to allow immigrants to stay in the U.S. without the fear of getting deported, but perhaps what's more surprising is that after Obama, George H.W. Bush – a Republican president – by himself provided relief for the second-highest amount of immigrants.</p>

  <p>Here's a chronological breakdown of those numbers according to an <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/docs/executive_grants_of_temporary_immigration_relief_1956-present_final_4.pdf">October 2014 report</a> from the American Immigration Council. Combinations of presidents represent executive actions that were passed down and continued from one president to another.</p>

  <IMG SRC="immigrants.png" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=388>

  <p>As the numbers show, Obama has so far provided 1.8 million childhood immigrant arrivals with deportation relief under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA (2012) – accounting for a third of total immigration relief since 1956. Next in line is Bush Sr. – and that 1.6 million doesn't even include his deferred deportation plan for 190,000 El Salvadorans that President Bill Clinton continued in 1992.</p>

  <p>Bush Sr. was able to pass sweeping immigration reform because of the bipartisanship that existed in Congress at the time. Back then, both sides of the aisle agreed the immigration system needed a major revamp. They didn't want to separate families. Now, Obama has the challenge of working with a polarized Congress, where many of his bold initiatives result in gridlock on Capitol Hill, ultimately leading to a government shutdown.</p>

  <p>In total, Obama’s new immigration action will provide deportation relief for 5.67 million immigrants, including 4 million immigrant parents who will be protected if they have been in the U.S. for at least five years and have kids who are citizens or legal residents by green card. The amount of immigrants that fall under his recent executive action is strikingly higher than any other group of immigrants who received relief under previous presidents since the Eisenhower era. But while Republican opponents in Congress get ready to tussle with Obama on his plan, it's difficult to overlook the massive immigration overhaul carried out from the late '80s to early '90s by a president from their own party.</p>
