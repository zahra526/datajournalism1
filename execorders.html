  <h1>I'VE GOT THE (EXECUTIVE) POWER!</h1>
  
  <h4>BY ZAHRA AHMED</h4>

  <p id>When President Barack Obama used his legal executive authority to announce his new immigration plan on November 20, many opponents in Congress charged that this move was similar to a king or a monarch.</p>

  <p>But for over half a century, American presidents have used their executive powers to relieve immigrant individuals and families of deportation. In fact, every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has taken executive action on immigration. Democratic and Republican presidents alike have passed executive actions to allow immigrants to stay in the U.S., but perhaps what's more surpising is that George H.W. Bush – a Republican president – by himself provided the second-most relief for immigrants at more than 1.6 million.</p>

  <p>Here is a breakdown of those numbers according to an <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/docs/executive_grants_of_temporary_immigration_relief_1956-present_final_4.pdf">October 2014 report</a> from the American Immigration Council.</p>

  <p>As the numbers show, Obama has provided 1.8 million childhood arrivals with deportation relief in 2012 under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA – accounting for a third of total immigration relief since 1956. Next in line is George H.W. Bush – and that’s not even including his deferred deportation plan for 190,000 El Salvadorans that President Bill Clinton continued in 1992.</p>

  <p>Bush Sr. was able to pass sweeping immigration reform with the help of a bipartisan-acting Congress that agreed the immigration system back then needed a major revamp. He didn't have the challenge of working with a polarized Congress, where many of Obama’s plans lead to gridlock, ultimately leading to a government shutdown.</p>

  <p>In total, Obama’s new plan will provide deportation relief for 5.67 million immigrants, including 4 million immigrant parents who will be protected from deportation if they have been in the U.S. for at least five years and have kids who are citizens or legal residents by green card. That number is strikingly higher than any other amount of immigrants who received relief under other previous Democratic or Republican presidents’ executive actions on immigration. But while Republican opponents in Congress get ready to fight his executive action on immigration, it's difficult to overlook the massive immigration overhaul carried out from the late '80s to early '90s by a president from their own party.</p>
