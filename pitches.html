<title>Pitches</title>
<p></p><h2>Pitch 1: Gentrification in Lower Manhattan</h2><p></p>
<p>The issue of gentrification is not new in New York City, but recently many longtime rent-regulated tenants in lower Manhattan have been forced out of their homes by illegal harassment tactics used by landlords who want to replace these tenants with new ones that will pay market-rate rents. I'm already covering this issue for my investigative class but would like to create a data visualization piece to go along with it.</p>
<p>There are three landlords I'm focusing on who are buying up a lot of property: <a href="http://ny.curbed.com/tags/samy-mahfar">Samy Mahfar</a> of SMA Equities, Jared Kushner of <a href="http://www.westminsternyc.com/apartment-search/">Westminster City Living</a> and <a href="http://www.cromantenants.org/properties">Steve Croman</a> of 9300 Realty. These landlords have bought many residential buildings and are renovating them and buying out old tenants to bring in new ones who will pay more for rent.</p>
<p>For my data visualization piece, I'd like to create a detailed map of apartment buildings in lower Manhattan that have been bought by all three landlords. What I'm imagining is a map of lower Manhattan (that looks like <a href="http://images.travelpod.com/cache/accom_maps/The_Manhattan_At_Times_Square_Hotel-Albany.gif">this</a> with a sidebar that lets you click on each landlord's name and a group of buildings will be highlighted by a color to show that it belongs to a certain landlord.</p>
<p>I'd like to pitch this to <a href="http://www.vox.com/">vox.com</a> because I think it would interest their readers and they have an entire section of the website dedicated to just <a href="http://www.vox.com/maps">maps</a>.</p>

<p></p><h2>Pitch 2: Where Syrian Refugees Resettle</h2><p></p>
<p>With the Islamic State making territorial gains on the Syria-Iraq border and Syria's ongoing civil war, many Syrians are fleeing their homeland. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that about 2.6 million Syrians have been displaced since the civil war began in 2011. As the conflict grows in bordering Iraq, many Syrians are seeking safety and assistance in other countries around the world. In September 2013, the UNHCR asked countries around the world to admit a total of 30,000 refugees from 2013-2014 for resettlement or humanitarian admission.</p>
<p>2.6 million is a big number and the problem with a big number is that it's too abstract and difficult to understand. To make this number easier to visualize, I'd like to create a rotating world map of where Syrian refugees have resettled around the world. To do this, I will use <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/52b2febafc5.html">data</a> released by the UNHCR on September 25, 2014, listing how many Syrian refugees have resettled in which countries.</p>

<p></p><h2>Pitch 3: Population Density Footprint</h2><p></p>
<p>If people lived as densely as Country X on all of Earth's inhabitable land, then X many people would live in the world.
</p><p>To do this, I would need to know the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.POP.DNST?order=wbapi_data_value_2013+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&sort=desc">population density of each country</a>, and I'm going to use the data for people per square kilometer of land area. I also need to know the total area of inhabitable land on Earth by square kiolmeters. According to this <a href="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/Thoc/land.html">website</a>, the total land surface area of Earth is about 57,308,738 square miles, or 148,429,000 square kilometers, of which about 33 and 24 percent is desert and mountainous respectively. When you subtract this total 57 percent of uninhabitable land from Earth's land surface area, you're left with 63,824,470 square kilometers of inhabitable land.</p>
<p>For example, if people lived on all of Earth's inhabitable land as densely as Monaco, the most densely populated country with 18,916 people per square kilometer - hypothetically - that would mean that 1,207,303,674,520, or more than 1.2 trillion, people could live in the world. On the other hand, if people lived  as densely as Mongolia, with only 2 people per square kilometer, only 127,648,940 people would populate Earth's inhabitable land, which is only about 1.8 percent of the world's total 7.125 billion population.</p>
<p>I want to create a world map that allows the user to scroll through a list of countries, click on a country's name and then be able to see how densely the world would be populated. To do this, I want to create a choropleth map similar to <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606">this one</a> we've seen in class.</p></body></html>
